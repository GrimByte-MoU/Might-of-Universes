# Might of Universes

An expansive content mod for tModLoader that largely adds post-Moon Lord content to Terraria!

## About the Mod

Might of Universes is a post-Moon Lord content expansion featuring:
- **Unique Weapons**: Plenty of new weapons and armors, with many more planned
- **Custom Debuffs**: A ton of debuffs to help you slay cosmic entities
- **New Materials**: From the early game Goblin Scrap/Cloth and Sweetgum Bar all the way to the end game Sagittarius Bars
- **Post-Moon Lord Focus**: Challenging endgame content designed for experienced players
- **Pre-Moonlord Expansion and Rebalancing**: Rebalancing of plenty of vanilla weapons, accessories and bosses to better fit the power of the mod
- **New Class and Subclass**: Introducing the Reaper class, they utilize scythes and soul lanterns to gather and consume souls, a new mechanic. Also,
  there is also a new subclass that focuses on nonweapon (armor and accessories) damage, this "class" is called pacifist! All damaging vanilla accessories have been reclassed to this
